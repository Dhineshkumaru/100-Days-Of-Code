# 100 Days Of Code - Log Round 2

### Day 1: May 24, 2019

**Plans for Today:**
1. Figure out how to make an array list of choices to work
2. Test whether or not getTotalPrice() actually adds up a price of a base as well as other options
3. Finilize a hash map and test to make sure it works properly
4. Tidy up the lab and make the formatting look pretty

**Today's Progress:**
1. Did everything I mentioned in plans for today in less time than expected
2. It was quite depressing to figure out that the only reason why my lab did not work at first is dur to out-commenting some piece of code while testing. 
For future reference: make sure nothing is commented that has a major influence on your code.

**Thoughts:**
Too tired today to work on something code-related, so for the rest of the night I am planning to draw something in my new sketcbook.

**Plans for tomorrow:**
1. Fix errors with Django app and continue working on it.
2. Read about fixing Value Error in train_test_split
3. Python exercises and algorthms (at least one chunk (45minutes))
4. C++ course (one chunk 45minutes)
