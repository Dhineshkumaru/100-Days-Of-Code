# 100 Days Of Code - Log Round 2

### Day 3: May 26, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Spend 3-4 hours writing and refactoring code for the extension. Fail, try again, fail, try even more.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Watched some YouTube videos about multithreading in Java
2. Read lab description and started to brainstorm how I can implement it

**Thoughts:**
I'm getting a huge feeling of dissatisfaction at night right now when looking back at the progress of Round 2. I drew even more but drawing does not nearly make me feel as productive as coding :<. Have to find the right combination of enjoying drawing at the same time as getting shit done with coding.

*None*

**Plans for tomorrow:**

1. Start working on the lab
2. Tackle the multithreading in the driver first, then everywhere else.
3. Do a few of JavaScript30, only have a few days left and need to finish it asap.

### Day 2: May 25, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Do at least 2-3 #javascript30 exercises, while also trying to add extra features to each
2. Decide on what topic to focus my first blog post, as well as start writing for it. So far leaning towards lessons learned during my first year of teaching myself how to code.
3. Think of any funny comic or sticker ideas. Coding plus creativity is the best!
4. Watch at least 2-3 videos about multithreading in Java and compare it to async JavaScript

**Today's Progress:**

1. Caught up with coding-related emailf from Chris Ferdinandi
2. Refactored a tiny bit of MDN Search Extension's stylying
3. Took a first attempt at implementing a feature where the first item in the list is automatically selected as user dynamically types information. Also attempted at making arrow up and down work when it comes to focusing on a li element. Failed, will try again later.

**Thoughts:**
Wanted to spend this Sunday drawing and relaxing after all the tensity during the last month. But I really should put more hours into building that extension!

### Day 1: May 24, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Figure out how to make an array list of choices to work
2. Test whether or not getTotalPrice() actually adds up a price of a base as well as other options
3. Finilize a hash map and test to make sure it works properly
4. Tidy up the lab and make the formatting look pretty

**Today's Progress:**

1. Did everything I mentioned in plans for today in less time than expected
2. It was quite depressing to figure out that the only reason why my lab did not work at first is dur to out-commenting some piece of code while testing.
   For future reference: make sure nothing is commented that has a major influence on your code.

**Thoughts:**
Too tired today to work on something code-related, so for the rest of the night I am planning to draw something in my new sketcbook.
