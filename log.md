# 100 Days Of Code - Log Round 2

### Day 23: June 15, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Apply to another 10 job postings
2. Start writing a tech article
3. Apply for a talk/workshopp at Spectra Hackathon
4. Watch videos about servers in Java and work on lab 5

**Today's Progress:**

1. Applied to 20 jobs today, although the original goal was just 10!
2. Constructed a simple footer for Femochi's Colors
3. Watched quite a lot of YouTuvbe videos on various things
4. Created a Twitter account for a cool bot idea I have in mind, yet after following 3 different tutorials I just ended up wasting 3+ hours of time since they were all outdated. Turns out 'Twit' now has new methods and there's no proper tutorials for it so I'll have to read official documentation instead. Sounds a bit scary!

**Thoughts:**
Got bangs, its my third time having them! :> Super excited yet I don't want to re-draw my avatar again this year.

**Plans for tomorrow:**

1. Pick 7-8 custom color pallete for Femochi's Colors, record it as variables in SCSS and use just them!
2. Adjust footer to look even better and more professional, perhaps links would have a different colored section than 'copyright'

### Day 21: June 13, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Start working on lab 5, both the client and server side

**Today's Progress:**

1. Listened to another The Console Log episode, only 20 episodes left until catching up!
2. Read two last Chris Ferdinandi's emails about JavaScript's better implementation for color picker and how to make an image full-width with CSS

**Thoughts:**
Had to write a 5 page economics report on the stock I've invested in, so did not have much free time today for coding :<

### Day 20: June 12, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Start working on lab 5, both the client and server side

**Today's Progress:**

1. Made sure that Femohi's Colors look good on every single screen size that Google Dev Tools proposes. The only exception is how it looks on iPad Pro, b/c if it looks good on iPad Pro than its trash for the desktop. Don't know how to figure it out yet, haha
2. Started sketching out the next 'Subscription' section in my notepad. Not exactly sure how UI will look yet but now I have a rough idea.

**Thoughts:**
Lab 5 is about working with server and client side, all on backend. It looks really intimidating just by reading the lab. Perhaps before even that, I should watch some YouTube videos in order to get my technical knowledge right.

### Day 19: June 11, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Figure out a way to make 'About' section as unique as the rest of the website. SO far I've been thinking about doing a small 5px colored border but because the top of this section is slanted, its complicated to do it :<
2. Work on lab 5, the deadline is approaching!

**Today's Progress:**

1. Added meta tags, thus making the website look good on all mobile versions. People on Twitter helped with this issue <3
2. Solved the problem with adding colored border to the About section by adding z-index to icons section and about
section, and then adding top padding to about section while also moving it up. Not sure if it makes sense but if anyone is interested I can explain it more in depth. Thus one goals out of two today is completed!
3. Spent three hours building a JS tic tac toe game with Martin. Learned that server is responsible for calling dfferent HTML & CSS for every page's ending(aka 'git.hub/account' or 'git.hub/pages')

**Thoughts:**
+36C in Cali yesterday and today, and must I say: having a cooler is a bliss!

### Day 18: June 10, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Continue writing an article about how to copy something to user's clipboard

**Today's Progress:**

1. Spent a ton of time today on the 'About' section of Femochi's Colors. Decided to go with a manimalistic view thus far
2. Finished the desktop version at first after reading an article of how to make an image float to the right instead of being right under. Then used media queries to make it go under when the text would get too small.

**Thoughts:**
Feel so proud of my work today and my ability to keep going even when stuck!
Parked a car today for the first time as my friends were teaching me how to drive. And yes, I didn't get my licence like other teens at 16 years old :>

### Day 17: June 9, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Start figuring out how to compare the contrat between the background and the foreground in order to change text to black whenever needed in that Random Gradient Generator

**Today's Progress:**

1. Read an article about the use of SASS/SCSS and how it is more useful than standard CSS. Took thorough notes on it
2. After learning about 'partials' in SASS, I refactored code in Femochi's colors from one giant SCSS file that I hated to use into minor files. It will be easier to manage them in the future.
3. Turns out that in order to access any folder in a directory, I have to use this syntax "../images/background-first.jpg"). Even if folder name is uppercase, when calling it in VSCode it has to be lowercase(!)

### Day 16: June 8, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Watch YouTube videos about running servers in Java
2. Start working on lab 5

**Today's Progress:**

1. Finally transitioned the random background picker into random gradient generator.
2. Not only it now generates a gradient but also whenever a user presses 'copy' button, it copies down the generated CSS for user's convenience: 'background-image: linear-gradient(to top right, #2d1dba, #f772ff);'.
3. Turns out whenever there are two white colors generated it is actually a lack of any color b/c such generated hex'es do not exist! Woah, need to figure out how to tackle this!

**Thoughts:**
Surprised that I still did not skip a single day on #100DaysOfCode :O You go, gurl!

### Day 15: June 7, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Implement a feature that copies random color to the clipboard
2. Somehow als check whether or not the contrast between background and foreground is accessible

**Today's Progress:**

1. Learned that surprisingly 'true + true' will return 2 in JavaScript :O
2. Used hints to help a fellow Lambda student solve Lambda challenges. At the end of it I also provided him
an explanation of why what he did worked or didn't to deeper his understanding
3. In the end solved 3 Lambda challenges on my own. Pushed the guy slowly in the right direction with his way of logival thinking.

**Thoughts:**
Found a cool comic called "Ava's Demon" and fell in love with the artstyle. Binge-read 2438 pages in one day XDD

### Day 14: June 6, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Instead of changing background color to black when colors are inaccessible, change the text color to black
2. Write the same generator but with hex code instead of standard colors
3. Change plain background generator to a gradient generator
4. Write a feature that will avoid same colors being generated

**Today's Progress:**

1. In about ten minutes refactored some code so that whenever the generated color is yellow, it would instead change all the text on the page from white to black.
2. Added copy to clipboard button and spent at least an hour struggling to make JS copy the color. Will continue working on it tomorrow
3. Now it acceptes hex colors(aka "#ffffff" instead of "white")
4. Learned that in JS empty array plus another empty arraay returns an empty string. As well as looked at other unexpected JS behaviors

**Thoughts:**
Its been first 2 weeks, yay!

### Day 13: June 5, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Either fix an issue with navigation scrolling on Femochi's Colors or find a different way to implement it and make it work properly
2. Listen to an episode or two of Tech Jr, loved this podcast <3

**Today's Progress:**

1. Read 3 emails from Chris Ferdinandi's email newsletter
2. Got inspired by one of the emails that talked about how to pick a random color with Vanilla JS and had an idea of implementing a quick application that allows user to randomly change background color. Wrote that webpage in just thirty minutes, felt so proud of myself!
3. Nearly at 12 am I finally implemented accessibility feature that tell the current color or "Current color was not accessible, defaulted to black!"

**Thoughts:**
Someone gave me an idea of implementing a feature that tests whether or not a color is accessible and if not changing it to black. Now I need to figure out how exactly to implement it!

**Link to work:**

### Day 12: June 4, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Continue learning node.js, perhaps watch a few beginner videos or 1-2 mid-level ones
2. Start diving into React using either React documentation or one resource(out of countless I already have)

**Today's Progress:**

1. Finished another The Console Log podcast episode, as well as finishined an episode of a new podcast I just started today: Tech Jr.
2. Learned that Node.js is not a programming lamguage nor a framework, instead it is a runtime environement for executing JavaScript code.
3. Watched Apple's WWDC19 keynote on YouTube to get an idea whats all the fuss going on Twitter :D

**Thoughts:**
Lately I've been spending on average 3-4 hours every day on playing cards with friends. No regrets, I can always pick up programming but making lasting friendships is way more complicated. There's less work to do for the rest of this week for De Anza, so I am planning to be more productive later.

### Day 11: June 3, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Read lab 5 and start brainstormin some of the structure
2. Start working on section 3 of the Femochi's Colors

**Today's Progress:**

1. Listened to two episodes of The Console Log podcast, I reached a point when there are now longer episodes with two hosts! Excited to listen to more news from a year ago as I am slowly catching up :)
2. Took notes on beginning Node.js YouTube video that I linked under 'Resources', as well as followed along the tutorial and left useful comments on the side of the application. Created my first tiny server by hand today, which just prints 'Hello there :>'!

**Thoughts:**
Only got an hour in the evening to code/learn something new, so I decided to advance my theoretical knowledge today.

### Day 10: June 2, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Find the styling for the first section that you like more or less and stick to it
2. Fix smooth scrolling issue

**Today's Progress:**

1. Watched a bit more videos on multithreading
2. Tweaked Femochi's Colors page a tiny bit

**Thoughts:**
Spent a whole day hanging out with friends, so not much done. Also had to work on a tapestry project in the evening :<

### Day 9: June 1, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Sit down and finish lab 4.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Edited lab 3 to fit class' criteria, aka moved my linked hash map from the driver to ProxyAuto in order for it to be even more reusable. Code looks so much cleaner now!
2. Watched various videos on YouTube about Java multithreading, a lot of these were hard to understand due to speakers' accents :<
3. Figured out how to import jQuery in html, so my JS now works in Femochi's Colors. Yay!
4. Spent time figureing out how to achieve smooth scrolling and why does mobile view using CodePen is different from local. After some time I managed to make it work by checking 'textContent' for every link. Turns out 'innerHTML' is a whole HTML of an element, while 'textContent' only demonstrates what text is inside the element. Still, smooth scrolling does not work as intended because it jumps randomly on a page after the first time it was clicked.
5. Refactored more code for first section, I feel like I'm slowly getting somewhere closer to where I want it to be.
6. Finished lab 4 that further enriched my knowledge of interfaces and multithreaing. 

**Thoughts:**
Wow, I've been quite productive today. Not on a level of professional-productive, but Kate-level productive :)

### Day 8: May 31, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Finish styling of first section completely in order to move on to "About" section.
2. Practice multithreading in Java, as well as start working on lab 4.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Read an article today about multithreading using Node.js. "Worker pool is an execution model that spawns and handles separate threads, which then synchronously perform the task and return the result to the event loop. The event loop then executes the provided callback with said result."

**Thoughts:**
Damn, I have never really followed my plans :D Perhaps I should start setting more realistic every day goals?

### Day 7: May 30, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Now that icon section is 100% done, I am planning to finish styling of first section completely in order to move on to "About" section.
2. Practice multithreading in Java, as well as start working on lab 4.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Learned about Web Workers in JavaScript, which essencially allow multithreaing in the background of JS's main thread. "Data is sent between the main thread and workers through messages. Since these workers run on a separate thread than the main execution thread, you can utilize web workers to run process intensive tasks from the browser without creating blocking instances."
2. Created an "Order Now" button with an SVG icon in the first section of Femochi's Colors

**Thoughts:**
Could have stayed up late in order to learn or build even more but wanted to get a delightful sleep today. Can't believe I spend so much time with my friends! :O

### Day 6: May 29, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Re-factor Femochi's Colors code into something more redable and less overwhelming
2. Listen to three or more The Console Log episodes

**Today's Progress:**

1. Finally completely transfered all the code from CodePen to VSCode for Femochi's Colors, so much easier to read and to test now!
2. Listened to two The Console Log podcast episodes
3. Figured out how to create slanted sections using a polygon shape, whereas previoussly I tried doing it using :after.

**Thoughts:**
It is an infinite enjoyment to see no CodePen navigation bar for me, it gives me inspiration to finish this front end as soon as possible.

### Day 5: May 28, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Work on lab 4 because it will be due today

**Today's Progress:**

1. Helped Shoha again to debug what was happening in his code through watching screenshots. Turns out he was calling a file from 'js' folder when that file was actually outside.
2. Listedned to a twenty minute episode of The Console Log podcast
3. Figured out how to finally(at like 12am) be able to have all my code from CodePen transformed into VSCode. I used Prepros to trasnform SCSS into CSS. It also looked like I had some old html code previously on GitHub, so updated it to proper code.

**Thoughts:**
Spent a lot of time on writing a three page Pop Culture midterm today.

**Link to work:**
*None*

**Plans for tomorrow:**

1. Congradulate Vlad at being accepted to Lambda School with me(which I'm confident will happen)
2. Re-factor Femochi's Colors code into something more redable and less overwhelming
3. Listen to three or more The Console Log episodes

**Resources:**
*None*


### Day 4: May 27, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Start working on the lab
2. Tackle the multithreading in the driver first, then everywhere else.
3. Do a few of JavaScript30, only have a few days left and need to finish it asap.
4. Fix Femochi's Colors first section, spend a few hours to finally get unstack

**Today's Progress:**

1. Found a way to implement slanted divs, and was able to add icons to it. Nevertheless, now I need to actually implement it in Femochi's Colors website.
2. Helped Shoha with his CSS code. He was struggling to figure out why certain images were very small on the page instead of a size he was expecting. I took a look at his code and the page using Chrome Dev Tools. Turns out he put that section into a big profile div that had a margin of 400px, so the simple solution was to just move that code outside profile's div.
3. Learned that browsers don't support raw SCSS and Sass, and that in order to use it in VSCode I'll have to first convert it to CSS.

**Thoughts:**
Went to play bouling with my friends. The amount of CSS code(~500 lines) I have in CodePen for Femochi's Colors is overwhelming, so in order to spend productive time working on it I'll have to figure out how to deal with it.

### Day 3: May 26, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Spend 3-4 hours writing and refactoring code for the extension. Fail, try again, fail, try even more.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Watched some YouTube videos about multithreading in Java
2. Read lab description and started to brainstorm how I can implement it

**Thoughts:**
I'm getting a huge feeling of dissatisfaction at night right now when looking back at the progress of Round 2. I drew even more but drawing does not nearly make me feel as productive as coding :<. Have to find the right combination of enjoying drawing at the same time as getting shit done with coding.

### Day 2: May 25, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Do at least 2-3 #javascript30 exercises, while also trying to add extra features to each
2. Decide on what topic to focus my first blog post, as well as start writing for it. So far leaning towards lessons learned during my first year of teaching myself how to code.
3. Think of any funny comic or sticker ideas. Coding plus creativity is the best!
4. Watch at least 2-3 videos about multithreading in Java and compare it to async JavaScript

**Today's Progress:**

1. Caught up with coding-related emailf from Chris Ferdinandi
2. Refactored a tiny bit of MDN Search Extension's stylying
3. Took a first attempt at implementing a feature where the first item in the list is automatically selected as user dynamically types information. Also attempted at making arrow up and down work when it comes to focusing on a li element. Failed, will try again later.

**Thoughts:**
Wanted to spend this Sunday drawing and relaxing after all the tensity during the last month. But I really should put more hours into building that extension!

### Day 1: May 24, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Figure out how to make an array list of choices to work
2. Test whether or not getTotalPrice() actually adds up a price of a base as well as other options
3. Finilize a hash map and test to make sure it works properly
4. Tidy up the lab and make the formatting look pretty

**Today's Progress:**

1. Did everything I mentioned in plans for today in less time than expected
2. It was quite depressing to figure out that the only reason why my lab did not work at first is dur to out-commenting some piece of code while testing.
   For future reference: make sure nothing is commented that has a major influence on your code.

**Thoughts:**
Too tired today to work on something code-related, so for the rest of the night I am planning to draw something in my new sketcbook.
