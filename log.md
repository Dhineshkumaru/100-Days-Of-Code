# 100 Days Of Code - Log Round 2

### Day 2: May 25, 2019

**Plans for Today:**
1. Do at least 2-3 #javascript30 exercises, while also trying to add extra features to each
2. Decide on what topic to focus my first blog post, as well as start writing for it. So far leaning towards lessons learned during my first year of teaching myself how to code.
3. Think of any funny comic or sticker ideas. Coding plus creativity is the best!
4. Watch at least 2-3 videos about multithreading in Java and compare it to async JavaScript

### Day 1: May 24, 2019

**Plans for Today:**
1. Figure out how to make an array list of choices to work
2. Test whether or not getTotalPrice() actually adds up a price of a base as well as other options
3. Finilize a hash map and test to make sure it works properly
4. Tidy up the lab and make the formatting look pretty

**Today's Progress:**
1. Did everything I mentioned in plans for today in less time than expected
2. It was quite depressing to figure out that the only reason why my lab did not work at first is dur to out-commenting some piece of code while testing. 
For future reference: make sure nothing is commented that has a major influence on your code.

**Thoughts:**
Too tired today to work on something code-related, so for the rest of the night I am planning to draw something in my new sketcbook.
