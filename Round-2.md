### Day 49: July 11, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Get ore familiar with the use of Git in order to traverse folders
2. Read more about Git in general

**Today's Progress:**

1. Forked, cloned and created a separate branch as well as created pull requests for all three projects we had at Lambda. 
2. Learned that git rebase basically 'merges' two brunches but uses an outside branch as a base to merge the master branch. Somehow already did not need to enter any logins/passwords when using Git for the last three months, still went through the process of generating an SSH key and connecting it with GitHub.

**Thoughts:**
Finished w/ Lambda early today and allowed myself time to draw!

2. Dig deeper into form validation
3. Review servlets and JSP

**Today's Progress:**

1. Completed the whole lambda challenge for today during lecture hours(total time: 2hrs taken), whereas everyone else just started working
on it after 2-3 hours. Spend extra time paying attention to every single detail to simulate the design
2. Spent 4 hours helping other students understand flexbox and hwo to think about it, extremely mentally exhausting
3. Created "About" section for the website completely on my own, after developing a unique design for it
4. Applied to 3 jobs

**Thoughts:**
After yesterday's 8 hour project, today it took me just 2 hours to finish the challenge! Helping people is an awesome experience but it's extremely tiring

**Plans for Today:**

1. Add at least 5 slides to the Spectra's presentation covering nesting & The Box model
2. Read about how only allow certain email to be sent w/ using input form, implement it on my existing form

**Today's Progress:**

1. Suffered through learning how to use `display: inline;`, `display: inline-block;` and `display: block;`. After using fleexbox it was quite hard to grasp these concepts, yet I managed to do it after sitting down and thinking about the box model & flows involved.
2. Now I know where to find CSS Resets that reset all styling some browsers might add as default
3. Helped someone to install Live Server and Prettier(also showed how to do so on autosave).

**Thoughts:**
Took 8 hours to finish the project instead of an assigned 4. Went from feeling relaxed to overwhelmed..if I want to get enough sleep, I'm afraid I won't have time for anything else besides Lambda!

**Link to work:**

**Today's Progress:**

1. Submitted two Lambda School challenges, nothing I haven't seen before. Did learn about a new tag <address>
2. Completed 4 JavaScript30 exercises, thus finishing the series. Wohoo!
3. Made a meme about too many tabs open
4. Learned new git commands that allow move into/from folders and create new files, before that only knew how
to clone repos & commit to master

**Thoughts:**
Quite slow beginning at Lambda for me, yet still managed to learn something new

1. Decide on how to organize my new stickers
2. Do 3-5 JavaScript30 exercises, perhaps just watch & follow along some that might not be completely useful.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Coded along Wes Bos and completed eight other JavaScript30 exercises, way more than I initially expected to do today!
2. Listened to another Console Log podcast episode
3. Added required to the input field in the form I worked on previously, as well as figured my next steps to improve it
4. After completing another JS30 tutorial with speech recognition I got a cute idea to do a doggo/cet that recieves a pizza when user says "Here's pizza"

**Thoughts:**
Feeling a bit anxious about Lambda. I don't really want to go over basics again, wish I could skip to the fun full stack stuff right away :>

**Plans for Today:**

1. At least another 5 slides
2. Decide on which project to live code during the work shop and produce a starter HTML&CSS code for it

**Today's Progress:**

1. Today I sat downn and pair programmed with my friend Vlad a simple email form. He wanted to learn more about how to work with plain CSS and HTML without using any bootstrap, I tried my best explaining the child-parent relationship of div containers in order to set up some fundamental knowledge.
2. Learned that unlike input which is unpaired tag, text area ia paired(through going over Vlad's Code)

**Thoughts:**
Last week was just an impressive amount of socializing.

1. Fix the "DeprecationWarning: current URL string parser is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version. To use the new parser, pass option { useNewUrlParser: true } to MongoClient.connect." bug in the form project.
2. Build the email form for mobile too, where a picture would go on top on a smaller screen.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Turns out the bug I mentioned earlier was because I mispelled one of the variables =.= Typical day where you spend a lot of time tackling a bug and it turns out to be nothing.
2. Listened to another The Console Log podcast

**Thoughts:**
Went to the beach with friends for the vast majority of the day.

### Day 41: July 3, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Touch up on the final UI for the form.
2. Build a small server(instead of using Live Server) and work with HTTP requests and responses in order to save the email data user enters.
3. Go through w3schools web development intro and figure out what is the most useful material to teach.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Wrote a small JavaScript server that demonstrates HTML+CSS form page I built yesterday on the screen, while
also being able to store th einformation user provides in a formatted text document
2. Downloaded MongoDB for the first time and began to get familiar with it's features. Used npm install MongoDB
to connect it to the current form I've been working on.
3. Wrote the code that connect MongoDB to written JS server, yet encountered "DeprecationWarning: current URL string parser is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version. To use the new parser, pass option { useNewUrlParser: true } to MongoClient.connect." so will have to fix it tomorrow

**Thoughts:**
Not as productive today because of social time with friends, applied to a few local team member jobs in person by filliong out applications and sharing printed resume. Then went to a friend's house and watched JoJo's Adventures :D

### Day 40: July 2, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Spend 7-8 hours gathering information for my workshop at Spectra
2. Start gathering slides and source code, create a GitHub folder with everything inside it.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Spent 3 hours gathering material for my Web Development workshop at Spectra. Already have 2 pages of notes regarding DOM theory alone plus started to design final draft of slides. Although originally I planned to only teach JavaScript and it's DOM manipulation, but turns out I'll have to gather more beginner friendly content regarding web development overall.
2. Martin explained how HTTP protocols connect HTML and JavaScript server-side. Built a small form that asks user's email and name and then stores it in a plain text file as a temporary database
3.Built a beautiful UI form in order to do n exercise where I'll send it to the database myself :>

**Thoughts:**
For whatever reason once I get over a fear of starting & failing immediately, I can just get lost in time and process of creating something. Love that feeling so much, wish I had more of it with backend development too.

### Day 39: July 1, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Start one of the React Udemy courses I've got for free from Thomas Weibenfalk
2. Do one or two JavaScript30 exercises by either following along or trying it out by yourself

**Today's Progress:**

1. Watched Franziska Hinkelmann's talk about JavaScript engines where my main takeaway was to have objects of the same type(meaning w/ same properties) in order to boost the performance. In case an object doesn't have a value for a certain property, than just list it as undefined.
2. Applied to a job and got instantly rejected in the same day.

**Thoughts:**
Organizing all my documents and notes for the last year, so I'd say I was productive in a different way today :P Took me a few hours but saved 2-3 cm of space.

**Link to work:**

### Day 38: June 30, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Finish the decoding function, add comments and send the code to the company who requested it.
2. Read all Chris Ferdinandi's newsletters for the last week, maybe find new ideas of building something

**Today's Progress:**

1. Managed to figure out how to delete a zero on the 8th place for decoding, after which writing to a new text file wa an easy skill to grasp
2. Checked by hand for the correct solution. Noticed that my program inserts a zero on a 9th place instead of the 8th place:
`11 01 11 011 01 11 11  => 6edf, inserts on the 9th location
11 01 11 101 01 11 11 => 6f5f, inserts on the 8th location`
Compared the values and figured out how to fix the problem.

**Thoughts:**
Only was at home at 8 pm after spending a whole day with friends, eating burgers, playing cards and pool and just chatting :>

### Day 37: June 29, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Apply to the CascadiaJS conference
2. Code the challenge provided by one company, even if at frst the solution would not be as perfectly clean.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Learned how to convert binary to hexadecimal to decimal in JavaScript
2. Finished the encoding function I mentioned on Day 35, was pretty challenging to put it together despite knowing theoretically how it is supposed to work.
3. Got three free Udemy courses, on which I am excited to get started!

**Thoughts:**
CascadiaJS seems to have at least 100 people who will attend, perhaps I should not apply there until my first teaching experience at Spectra Hachathon.

**Link to work:**

-----

### Day 36: June 28, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Figure out the easiet and cleanest way to implement that hexadecimal challenge
2. Learn about bitwise operators

**Today's Progress:**

1. Listened to the last Tech Junior episode + another episode of the Console Log.
2. JavaScript's method insertBefore() seems to be like a better option for the cell division effect I'm trying to implement since it allows an object to be inserted into a specific location inside parent node.

**Thoughts:**
Nan desu ka? Why am I just watching so much anime lately? :< Starting on Monday I need to implemet a better schedule for when Lambda School starts in two weeks.

-----

### Day 35: June 27, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Apply to CascadiaJS conference

**Today's Progress:**

1. Spent time learning about hexadecimals and how to convert them to regular decimals & binary.
2. Carefully read through the coding challenges one of the companies sent me, and started to brainstorm the logic behind the implementation. The solution would be to add 8192 to illuminate negative numbers from the 14-base system. Then convert to binary where a 0 would be entered on a 7th position, after which convert the result to the hexadecimal.
3. Talked to Christina and Shivani from Spectra hackathon chatting about the potential structure of my Dom manipulations with JS workshop. Here's an overview of what I'm now planning on doing: quick intro to DOM & what it is, set up CodePen for following along, slowly explain every line of code as I'm typing it(have HTML&CSS ready for copy-pasting), and at the end explain rules for the "Try Yourself" challenge

**Thoughts:**
Slowly getting back into anime :>

### Day 34: June 26, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Figure out why does forEach 'hover' event doesn't work
2. Append a new child element whenever one of the elements is hovered

**Today's Progress:**

1. Finished the Tech Jr podcast, soon to start the LadyBug podcast!
2. Turns out using forEach + event listener("click", function()) will call the function only the first n-amount of times. Instead, the way I fixed 'hover' event is through changing it to ("click", function)

**Thoughts:**
Even though I now have more free time, I spend a lot of it with friends instead of coding. Note to self: find a better balance but make sure to keep friends at the same time.

### Day 33: June 25, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Do at least 3-4 Javascript 30 exercises since my goal is to finish it completely before starting Lambda School.
2. Combine all Femochi's Colors together in one SASS file
3. Finish a proper footer for Femochi's Colors, as well as move further with 'Subscription' section

**Today's Progress:**

1. Applied to another entry-level job
2. Started working on the next 19th JavaScript30 exercise, yet got carried away with an interesting idea in my head to make kind of moving bubbles that would multiply by two and shrink in size every time one of the bubbles is hovered. Started to implement it, finished the CSS and HTML. 

**Thoughts:**
Wrote a letter to future self in five year, can't wait to read it again when it will be mailed to me! All my finals are over after today, so now it's time to breathe out. 
Secret message: Надеюсь тебе интересно это читать, будущая Катя :>. Вообще К---б бака, ты стоишь лучшего!

### Day 32: June 24, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Survive
2. Talk to Hung about how to start working on lab 6, since I'm *that* lost haha

**Today's Progress:**

1. Watched a variety of videos about JSP, to be honest perhaps I'd love to just do it in JavaScript outside of a college assignment
2. Learned that JSP is kind of a similar concept to changing HTML page dynamically using JavaScript

**Thoughts:**
Wrote a letter to future self in five year, can't wait to read it again when it will be mailed to me! All my finals are over after today, so now it's time to breathe out. 
Secret message: Надеюсь тебе интересно это читать, будущая Катя :>. Вообще К---б бака, ты стоишь лучшего!

**Link to work:**
*None*

**Plans for tomorrow:**

1. Do at least 3-4 Javascript 30 exercises since my goal is to finish it completely before starting Lambda School.
2. Combine all Femochi's Colors together in one SASS file
3. Finish a proper footer for Femochi's Colors, as well as move further with 'Subscription' section

### Day 29: June 21, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Finish lab 5
2. Customize the fotter for Femochi's Colors

**Today's Progress:**

1. Solved the IO problem, turns out all I had to do is to copy the modified Auto from the client to the server
2. Read over lab 6 requirenments, took notes in order to remember better what is requested of me
3. Took notes on HTTP, now all those 'req' and 'res' I kept seeing in React with HTTp make sense to me. It was also interesting to learn how client is the one always making requests or sending info to the server, which in turn either returns some data or processes data.

**Thoughts:**
So happy to see Lab 5 working!

2. Figure out how to read Properties object, serialize it and send it to the server

**Today's Progress:**

1. Applied to 2 software engineer positions through writing emails
2. Thanks to Ahror, figured out how to connect client and server together. Now I understand better the structures of the lab, so it'll be easier to work on it
3. Listened to another Tech JR episode <3
4. Created logic & implemented for getAllModels method where I am storing an ArrayList of all model names inside ProxyAuto, and recording them each time buildAuto method is called(the one that adds a car to the linked hash map)

**Thoughts:**

### Day 25: June 17, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Code on lab 5
2. Implement a test to only retweet with a picture url and/or a link to CodePen
3. Figure out why the bot does not retweet instantly like other bots

**Today's Progress:**

1. Applied to 2 front end developer positions
2. Got my first PR merged today!
3. Had a conversation with Java's professor in order to better understand the client-server lab, still struggling with understanding of it

### Day 24: June 16, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Pick 7-8 custom color pallete for Femochi's Colors, record it as variables in SCSS and use just them!
2. Adjust footer to look even better and more professional, perhaps links would have a different colored section than 'copyright'

**Today's Progress:**

1. Spent three hours re-watching two Java lectures about Socket and ServerSocket in order to undertsand the concepts better.
2. Made a first pull request to the https://github.com/MCHadley/FinalProject_BookHub directory, just changed CSS a bit, but still felt great to make something better! Here's an image of how I changed it https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kefimochi/Variety-of-code/master/ffffffffffff.png, where padding in a previous search box was just too little
3. Figured out why Twitter bot didn't work yesterday, got it to finally console log something properly. As soon as I figured out that Twitter API returns an enormous JSON object with all information I need, creating a bot became easier :D Created a test that doesn't allow to retweet retweets.
4. Took a lot of notes on how lab 5 should be implemented, now that I have a really good understanding, its time to start coding.

**Thoughts:**
Excited to continue testing and debugging the Twitter bot!

2. Start writing a tech article
3. Apply for a talk/workshopp at Spectra Hackathon
4. Watch videos about servers in Java and work on lab 5

**Today's Progress:**

1. Applied to 20 jobs today, although the original goal was just 10!
2. Constructed a simple footer for Femochi's Colors
3. Watched quite a lot of YouTuvbe videos on various things
4. Created a Twitter account for a cool bot idea I have in mind, yet after following 3 different tutorials I just ended up wasting 3+ hours of time since they were all outdated. Turns out 'Twit' now has new methods and there's no proper tutorials for it so I'll have to read official documentation instead. Sounds a bit scary!

### Day 20: June 12, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Start working on lab 5, both the client and server side

**Today's Progress:**

1. Made sure that Femohi's Colors look good on every single screen size that Google Dev Tools proposes. The only exception is how it looks on iPad Pro, b/c if it looks good on iPad Pro than its trash for the desktop. Don't know how to figure it out yet, haha
2. Started sketching out the next 'Subscription' section in my notepad. Not exactly sure how UI will look yet but now I have a rough idea.

**Thoughts:**
Lab 5 is about working with server and client side, all on backend. It looks really intimidating just by reading the lab. Perhaps before even that, I should watch some YouTube videos in order to get my technical knowledge right.

### Day 19: June 11, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Figure out a way to make 'About' section as unique as the rest of the website. SO far I've been thinking about doing a small 5px colored border but because the top of this section is slanted, its complicated to do it :<
2. Work on lab 5, the deadline is approaching!

**Today's Progress:**

1. Added meta tags, thus making the website look good on all mobile versions. People on Twitter helped with this issue <3
2. Solved the problem with adding colored border to the About section by adding z-index to icons section and about
section, and then adding top padding to about section while also moving it up. Not sure if it makes sense but if anyone is interested I can explain it more in depth. Thus one goals out of two today is completed!
3. Spent three hours building a JS tic tac toe game with Martin. Learned that server is responsible for calling dfferent HTML & CSS for every page's ending(aka 'git.hub/account' or 'git.hub/pages')

**Thoughts:**
+36C in Cali yesterday and today, and must I say: having a cooler is a bliss!

### Day 18: June 10, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Continue writing an article about how to copy something to user's clipboard

**Today's Progress:**

1. Spent a ton of time today on the 'About' section of Femochi's Colors. Decided to go with a manimalistic view thus far
2. Finished the desktop version at first after reading an article of how to make an image float to the right instead of being right under. Then used media queries to make it go under when the text would get too small.

**Thoughts:**
Feel so proud of my work today and my ability to keep going even when stuck!

### Day 17: June 9, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Start figuring out how to compare the contrat between the background and the foreground in order to change text to black whenever needed in that Random Gradient Generator

**Today's Progress:**

1. Read an article about the use of SASS/SCSS and how it is more useful than standard CSS. Took thorough notes on it
2. After learning about 'partials' in SASS, I refactored code in Femochi's colors from one giant SCSS file that I hated to use into minor files. It will be easier to manage them in the future.
3. Turns out that in order to access any folder in a directory, I have to use this syntax "../images/background-first.jpg"). Even if folder name is uppercase, when calling it in VSCode it has to be lowercase(!)

### Day 16: June 8, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Watch YouTube videos about running servers in Java
2. Start working on lab 5

**Today's Progress:**

1. Finally transitioned the random background picker into random gradient generator.
2. Not only it now generates a gradient but also whenever a user presses 'copy' button, it copies down the generated CSS for user's convenience: 'background-image: linear-gradient(to top right, #2d1dba, #f772ff);'.
3. Turns out whenever there are two white colors generated it is actually a lack of any color b/c such generated hex'es do not exist! Woah, need to figure out how to tackle this!

**Thoughts:**
Surprised that I still did not skip a single day on #100DaysOfCode :O You go, gurl!

### Day 15: June 7, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Implement a feature that copies random color to the clipboard
2. Somehow als check whether or not the contrast between background and foreground is accessible

**Today's Progress:**

1. Learned that surprisingly 'true + true' will return 2 in JavaScript :O
2. Used hints to help a fellow Lambda student solve Lambda challenges. At the end of it I also provided him
an explanation of why what he did worked or didn't to deeper his understanding
3. In the end solved 3 Lambda challenges on my own. Pushed the guy slowly in the right direction with his way of logival thinking.

### Day 14: June 6, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Instead of changing background color to black when colors are inaccessible, change the text color to black
2. Write the same generator but with hex code instead of standard colors
3. Change plain background generator to a gradient generator
4. Write a feature that will avoid same colors being generated

**Today's Progress:**

1. In about ten minutes refactored some code so that whenever the generated color is yellow, it would instead change all the text on the page from white to black.
2. Added copy to clipboard button and spent at least an hour struggling to make JS copy the color. Will continue working on it tomorrow
3. Now it acceptes hex colors(aka "#ffffff" instead of "white")
4. Learned that in JS empty array plus another empty arraay returns an empty string. As well as looked at other unexpected JS behaviors

**Thoughts:**
Its been first 2 weeks, yay!

### Day 13: June 5, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Either fix an issue with navigation scrolling on Femochi's Colors or find a different way to implement it and make it work properly
2. Listen to an episode or two of Tech Jr, loved this podcast <3

**Today's Progress:**

1. Read 3 emails from Chris Ferdinandi's email newsletter
2. Got inspired by one of the emails that talked about how to pick a random color with Vanilla JS and had an idea of implementing a quick application that allows user to randomly change background color. Wrote that webpage in just thirty minutes, felt so proud of myself!
3. Nearly at 12 am I finally implemented accessibility feature that tell the current color or "Current color was not accessible, defaulted to black!"

**Thoughts:**
Someone gave me an idea of implementing a feature that tests whether or not a color is accessible and if not changing it to black. Now I need to figure out how exactly to implement it!

### Day 12: June 4, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Continue learning node.js, perhaps watch a few beginner videos or 1-2 mid-level ones
2. Start diving into React using either React documentation or one resource(out of countless I already have)

**Today's Progress:**

1. Finished another The Console Log podcast episode, as well as finishined an episode of a new podcast I just started today: Tech Jr.
2. Learned that Node.js is not a programming lamguage nor a framework, instead it is a runtime environement for executing JavaScript code.
3. Watched Apple's WWDC19 keynote on YouTube to get an idea whats all the fuss going on Twitter :D

**Thoughts:**
Lately I've been spending on average 3-4 hours every day on playing cards with friends. No regrets, I can always pick up programming but making lasting friendships is way more complicated. There's less work to do for the rest of this week for De Anza, so I am planning to be more productive later.

### Day 9: June 1, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Sit down and finish lab 4.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Edited lab 3 to fit class' criteria, aka moved my linked hash map from the driver to ProxyAuto in order for it to be even more reusable. Code looks so much cleaner now!
2. Watched various videos on YouTube about Java multithreading, a lot of these were hard to understand due to speakers' accents :<
3. Figured out how to import jQuery in html, so my JS now works in Femochi's Colors. Yay!
4. Spent time figureing out how to achieve smooth scrolling and why does mobile view using CodePen is different from local. After some time I managed to make it work by checking 'textContent' for every link. Turns out 'innerHTML' is a whole HTML of an element, while 'textContent' only demonstrates what text is inside the element. Still, smooth scrolling does not work as intended because it jumps randomly on a page after the first time it was clicked.
5. Refactored more code for first section, I feel like I'm slowly getting somewhere closer to where I want it to be.
6. Finished lab 4 that further enriched my knowledge of interfaces and multithreaing. 

**Thoughts:**
Wow, I've been quite productive today. Not on a level of professional-productive, but Kate-level productive :)

### Day 8: May 31, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Finish styling of first section completely in order to move on to "About" section.
2. Practice multithreading in Java, as well as start working on lab 4.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Read an article today about multithreading using Node.js. "Worker pool is an execution model that spawns and handles separate threads, which then synchronously perform the task and return the result to the event loop. The event loop then executes the provided callback with said result."

**Thoughts:**
Damn, I have never really followed my plans :D Perhaps I should start setting more realistic every day goals?

1. Now that icon section is 100% done, I am planning to finish styling of first section completely in order to move on to "About" section.
2. Practice multithreading in Java, as well as start working on lab 4.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Learned about Web Workers in JavaScript, which essencially allow multithreaing in the background of JS's main thread. "Data is sent between the main thread and workers through messages. Since these workers run on a separate thread than the main execution thread, you can utilize web workers to run process intensive tasks from the browser without creating blocking instances."
2. Created an "Order Now" button with an SVG icon in the first section of Femochi's Colors

**Thoughts:**
Could have stayed up late in order to learn or build even more but wanted to get a delightful sleep today. Can't believe I spend so much time with my friends! :O

### Day 6: May 29, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Re-factor Femochi's Colors code into something more redable and less overwhelming
2. Listen to three or more The Console Log episodes

**Today's Progress:**

1. Finally completely transfered all the code from CodePen to VSCode for Femochi's Colors, so much easier to read and to test now!
2. Listened to two The Console Log podcast episodes
3. Figured out how to create slanted sections using a polygon shape, whereas previoussly I tried doing it using :after.

**Thoughts:**
It is an infinite enjoyment to see no CodePen navigation bar for me, it gives me inspiration to finish this front end as soon as possible.

### Day 5: May 28, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Work on lab 4 because it will be due today

**Today's Progress:**

1. Helped Shoha again to debug what was happening in his code through watching screenshots. Turns out he was calling a file from 'js' folder when that file was actually outside.
2. Listedned to a twenty minute episode of The Console Log podcast
3. Figured out how to finally(at like 12am) be able to have all my code from CodePen transformed into VSCode. I used Prepros to trasnform SCSS into CSS. It also looked like I had some old html code previously on GitHub, so updated it to proper code.

**Thoughts:**
Spent a lot of time on writing a three page Pop Culture midterm today.

**Plans for tomorrow:**

1. Congradulate Vlad at being accepted to Lambda School with me(which I'm confident will happen)
2. Re-factor Femochi's Colors code into something more redable and less overwhelming
3. Listen to three or more The Console Log episodes

**Resources:**

### Day 4: May 27, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Start working on the lab
2. Tackle the multithreading in the driver first, then everywhere else.
3. Do a few of JavaScript30, only have a few days left and need to finish it asap.
4. Fix Femochi's Colors first section, spend a few hours to finally get unstack

**Today's Progress:**

1. Found a way to implement slanted divs, and was able to add icons to it. Nevertheless, now I need to actually implement it in Femochi's Colors website.
2. Helped Shoha with his CSS code. He was struggling to figure out why certain images were very small on the page instead of a size he was expecting. I took a look at his code and the page using Chrome Dev Tools. Turns out he put that section into a big profile div that had a margin of 400px, so the simple solution was to just move that code outside profile's div.
3. Learned that browsers don't support raw SCSS and Sass, and that in order to use it in VSCode I'll have to first convert it to CSS.

**Thoughts:**
Went to play bouling with my friends. The amount of CSS code(~500 lines) I have in CodePen for Femochi's Colors is overwhelming, so in order to spend productive time working on it I'll have to figure out how to deal with it.

**Plans for tomorrow:**

1. Work on lab 4 because it will be due tomorrow

### Day 3: May 26, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Spend 3-4 hours writing and refactoring code for the extension. Fail, try again, fail, try even more.

**Today's Progress:**

1. Watched some YouTube videos about multithreading in Java
2. Read lab description and started to brainstorm how I can implement it

**Thoughts:**
I'm getting a huge feeling of dissatisfaction at night right now when looking back at the progress of Round 2. I drew even more but drawing does not nearly make me feel as productive as coding :<. Have to find the right combination of enjoying drawing at the same time as getting shit done with coding.

### Day 2: May 25, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Do at least 2-3 #javascript30 exercises, while also trying to add extra features to each
2. Decide on what topic to focus my first blog post, as well as start writing for it. So far leaning towards lessons learned during my first year of teaching myself how to code.
3. Think of any funny comic or sticker ideas. Coding plus creativity is the best!
4. Watch at least 2-3 videos about multithreading in Java and compare it to async JavaScript

**Today's Progress:**

1. Caught up with coding-related emailf from Chris Ferdinandi
2. Refactored a tiny bit of MDN Search Extension's stylying
3. Took a first attempt at implementing a feature where the first item in the list is automatically selected as user dynamically types information. Also attempted at making arrow up and down work when it comes to focusing on a li element. Failed, will try again later.

**Thoughts:**
Wanted to spend this Sunday drawing and relaxing after all the tensity during the last month. But I really should put more hours into building that extension!

### Day 1: May 24, 2019

**Plans for Today:**

1. Figure out how to make an array list of choices to work
2. Test whether or not getTotalPrice() actually adds up a price of a base as well as other options
3. Finilize a hash map and test to make sure it works properly
4. Tidy up the lab and make the formatting look pretty

**Today's Progress:**

1. Did everything I mentioned in plans for today in less time than expected
2. It was quite depressing to figure out that the only reason why my lab did not work at first is dur to out-commenting some piece of code while testing.
   For future reference: make sure nothing is commented that has a major influence on your code.

**Thoughts:**
Too tired today to work on something code-related, so for the rest of the night I am planning to draw something in my new sketcbook.
